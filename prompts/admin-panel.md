# Instructions for Creating an Admin Panel on /app/dashboard/admin/page.js

## 1. Overview

Create an admin panel at the route `/app/dashboard/admin/page.js` using schadcn styles. The admin panel should allow the admin to view all users in the database as rows in a table format. Upon clicking a user row, the panel should fetch and display all documents generated by that user. The admin should be able to modify, save, or delete any document directly from the interface.

## 2. Setup and Configuration

- **Route**: Create the admin panel page at `/app/dashboard/admin/page.js`.
- **Framework**: Ensure the project is using Next.js.
- **Styling**: Utilize `schadcn` styles for all UI components to maintain a consistent design throughout the application.
- **API Integration**: Ensure all API requests for fetching user data and documents, as well as for modifying and deleting documents, are properly set up and hooked into the admin panel.

## 3. User Data Fetching

- **Initial Fetch**:
  - On page load, make an API call to fetch all user data from the database.
  - Display each user as a row in a table. Each row should include relevant user information (e.g., user ID, name, email, registration date).

- **API Endpoint**:
  - Create or use an existing API endpoint (e.g., `/api/users`) to fetch all user data.
  - Ensure the endpoint returns data in a format that can be easily iterated over and displayed in the table.

## 4. Table Display

- **Table Structure**:
  - Create a table with columns for user ID, name, email, registration date, and any other relevant user information.
  - Each row should represent a single user.

- **Row Interactivity**:
  - Make each user row clickable. On click, trigger an API call to fetch all documents generated by the selected user.

## 5. Fetching User Documents

- **API Call on Row Click**:
  - When a user row is clicked, make an API call to fetch all documents associated with that user.
  - Use a dedicated API endpoint (e.g., `/api/users/{userId}/documents`) to retrieve the documents.

- **Display User Documents**:
  - Upon fetching, display the documents in a secondary section of the admin panel.
  - List each document with details such as document title, type ... and so on

## 6. Document Editing and Management

- **Editable Fields**:
  - Each document should be displayed in a form format where every input field or textarea is editable.
  - Allow the admin to click on any input field or textarea to modify its content.

- **Saving Changes**:
  - Include a "Save" button for each document. When clicked, this button should make an API call to update the document in the database with the modified content.
 

- **Deleting Documents**:
  - Include a "Delete" button for each document. When clicked, prompt the admin for confirmation.
  - Upon confirmation, make an API call to delete the document from the database 

## 7. UI/UX Considerations

- **Confirmation Dialogs**:
  - Add confirmation dialogs for delete actions to prevent accidental deletions.
  
- **Loading Indicators**:
  - Implement loading indicators when fetching data or performing save/delete operations to provide feedback to the admin.

- **Error Handling**:
  - Display error messages in case any API call fails (e.g., fetching user data, saving changes, deleting documents).
  - Ensure errors are handled gracefully without breaking the page functionality.

## 8. Final Touches

- **Testing**:
  - Test the admin panel extensively to ensure all functionalities (fetching, editing, saving, deleting) work correctly.
  - Ensure the UI is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.

- **Documentation**:
  - Document the code and functionalities clearly for future reference and maintenance.
  
- **Performance Optimization**:
  - Optimize API calls to reduce load times and improve the panel's overall performance.
